       "xxbos i have bought several of the xxmaj vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality . xxmaj the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better . xxmaj my xxmaj labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most .,xxbos xxmaj product arrived labeled as xxmaj jumbo xxmaj salted xxmaj peanuts ... the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted . xxmaj not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \" xxmaj jumbo \" .,xxbos xxmaj this is a confection that has been around a few centuries . xxmaj it is a light , pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case xxmaj filberts . xxmaj and it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar . xxmaj and it is a tiny mouthful of heaven . xxmaj not too chewy , and very flavorful . i highly recommend this yummy treat . xxmaj if you are familiar with the story of xxup c.s. xxmaj lewis ' \" xxmaj the xxmaj lion , xxmaj the xxmaj witch , and xxmaj the xxmaj wardrobe \" - this is the treat that seduces xxmaj edmund into selling out his xxmaj brother and xxmaj sisters to the xxmaj witch .,xxbos xxmaj if you are looking for the secret ingredient in xxmaj robitussin i believe i have found it . i got this in addition to the xxmaj root xxmaj beer xxmaj extract i ordered ( which was good ) and made some cherry soda . xxmaj the flavor is very medicinal .,xxbos xxmaj great taffy at a great price . xxmaj there was a wide assortment of yummy taffy . xxmaj delivery was very quick . xxmaj if your a taffy lover , this is a deal .\n",

       "xxbos xxmaj this was a staple to my lower carb diet , loved it with walnuts and a sprinkle of xxmaj truvia floating in almond milk . xxmaj yum ! xxmaj now , it is xxup off my shopping list . i did find an alternative at a local health food store and it 's very good , comes in 4 flavors http : / / www.amazon.com / xxmaj nutritious - xxmaj living - xxmaj vanilla - xxmaj almond - xxmaj cereal / dp / xxup xxunk k / ref = xxunk = grocery&ie = xxunk - xxunk = xxunk,xxbos i still remember when mom or one of my brothers prepared this dessert , it took longer to cook than the time we took to finish it . xxmaj and is just great that i can make it now that i 'm married and my loved ones can taste the same lemon pie like in the old days . \n",
       "  xxmaj easy to make easier to enjoy .,xxbos xxmaj awful , xxmaj awful , xxmaj awful ! i like a lighter roast and i really love french vanilla so i was thrilled to find this one . xxmaj with the first sip i was highly disappointed . xxmaj it has a very strong artificial flavor that does n't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly does n't taste like coffee . xxmaj like one other reviewer said , i 'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because i do n't know anybody who would enjoy it . xxup yuk !,xxbos these cookies a tiny but tasty treasures . not very many to a package but a good size for lunches.at 24 per lot these are an okay value,xxbos xxmaj sorry , but i was n't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers . xxmaj okay , i admit that i never liked xxmaj oreos that much in the first place . xxmaj this 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like xxmaj oreos , for sure -- minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling . xxmaj but as one other reviewer noted , they 're not all that chocolaty , a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic . xxmaj worse than that , they 're not so good for you . xxmaj if you 're going to have 100 calories , there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar . xxmaj for my money , a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense . xxmaj it not only costs less , it 's got lots more nutritional value , not to mention fibre .\n",
